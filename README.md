# Project Egg
: First rocket flight computer (Avionics) built from scratch

: Every components soldered on the breadboard by hand

: C++ / C project

: It has had mutliple prototype test and one actual flight with Midium power rocket made by myself.


## State Machine ##
: state machine Based on collected flight data

: Using KalmanFilter to idealize the data

: it consisted of 5 state


0. idle
1. ascending
2. apogee
3. descending
4. landed
